## What & why

<One-line summary. Ticket refs: `Refs #…` (the maintainer closes tickets after review).>

## Reviewer checklist (before merge)

- [ ] **Data contract traced end to end:** every field/value flows intact through every layer that transforms it (e.g. handler, serializer, transport, client mapping, UI); no layer silently drops or renames it.
- [ ] Every layer that reshapes a payload has a test asserting the **whole** contract (all fields), not a subset. Prefer one shared builder over duplicated hand-built objects so they cannot drift.
- [ ] **Real path verified, not just unit tests:** drove the running code, captured the real payload at the boundary, confirmed the observable output. Green units plus approved reviews are not proof it works.
- [ ] No dead, speculative, or unwired code; no "known gaps".
- [ ] Tests cover happy, error, and boundary paths.
- [ ] Docs updated; CHANGELOG under `[Unreleased]` (committed at release).
